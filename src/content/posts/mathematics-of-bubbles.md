## The Mathematics of Natural Beauty

Found this piece about [the mathematics of soap bubbles](https://example.com) and how they solve optimization problems that challenge our best computers.

<div class="quote">
A soap bubble doesn't know calculus, yet it solves minimal surface problems with perfect elegance.

Beauty and efficiency are often the same thing. Nature has been doing computational optimization for billions of years, finding solutions that we're only now beginning to understand mathematically.
