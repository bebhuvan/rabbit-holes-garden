This is a sample post showing how different types of links and embeds are handled.

## Regular Link Previews

Here's a regular website link that will show as a preview:

/>

Sometimes you have regular text mixed with links. Here's a regular link that should also get a preview card:

<LinkPreview url="https://example.com" />

And here's some more text to show how it flows naturally in the content.
