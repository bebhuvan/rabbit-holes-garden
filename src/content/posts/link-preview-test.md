# Link Preview Test

This is a test post to check how different types of links are handled and displayed. Let's see what works and what needs improvement.

## Article Links

Here are some interesting articles from different platforms:

**Substack Article:**
[Against Truth - Sam Kriss](https://samkriss.substack.com/p/against-truth)

A philosophical exploration of truth in the modern world. This should show a rich preview with title, excerpt, and author information.

**The Economist:**
[Cigarettes, booze and petrol bankroll Europe's welfare empire](https://www.economist.com/europe/2025/07/24/cigarettes-booze-and-petrol-bankroll-europes-welfare-empire?utm_campaign=trueanthem&utm_medium=social&utm_source=linkedin)

An analysis of how sin taxes fund European social programs.

Links that should embed directly:
