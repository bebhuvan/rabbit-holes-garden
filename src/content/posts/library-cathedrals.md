## Cathedrals of Curiosity

A gorgeous photo series of [libraries around the world](https://example.com). Each tells a story through architecture, light, and invitation to wonder.

Looking at these spaces, I see cathedrals of curiosityâ€”places where knowledge becomes sacred, where silence amplifies thought. The Trinity College Library in Dublin holds 200,000 of the library's oldest books, creating a tunnel of wisdom that seems to stretch into infinity.
